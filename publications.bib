	abstract = {Background:  Many patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remain undiagnosed despite availability of interventions to reduce stroke risk. Predictive models to date are limited by data requirements and theoretical usage. We aimed to develop a model for predicting the 2-year probability of AF diagnosis and implement it as proof-of-concept (POC) in a production electronic health record (EHR).
Methods:  We used a nested case–control design using data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care. The develop‑ment cohort came from 2016 to 2017 (outcome period) and 2014 to 2015 (baseline). A separate validation cohort used outcome and baseline periods shifted 2 years before respective development cohort times. Machine learn‑ing approaches were used to build predictive model. Patients ≥ 18 years, later restricted to age ≥ 40 years, with at least two encounters and no AF during baseline, were included. In the 6-week EHR prospective pilot, the model was silently implemented in the production system at a large safety-net urban hospital. Three new and two previ‑ous logistic regression models were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristics. Number, characteristics, and ­CHA2DS2-VASc scores of patients identified by the model in the pilot are presented.
Results:  After restricting age to ≥ 40 years, 31,474 AF cases (mean age, 71.5 years; female 49\%) and 22,078 controls (mean age, 59.5 years; female 61\%) comprised the development cohort. A 10-variable model using age, acute heart disease, albumin, body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gender, heart failure, insurance, kidney disease, and shock yielded the best performance (C-statistic, 0.80 [95\% CI 0.79–0.80]). The model performed well in the validation cohort (C-statistic, 0.81 [95\% CI 0.8–0.81]). In the EHR pilot, 7916/22,272 (35.5\%; mean age, 66 years; female 50\%) were identified as higher risk for AF; 5582 (70\%) had ­CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2.
Conclusions:  Using variables commonly available in the EHR, we created a predictive model to identify 2-year risk of developing AF in those previously without diagnosed AF. Successful POC implementation of the model in an EHR provided a practical strategy to identify patients who may benefit from interventions to reduce their stroke risk.},

	abstract = {Background: Sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty have overlapping features and clinical consequences, but often go unrecognized. The objective was to detect patients described by clinicians as having sarcopenia, cachexia or frailty within electronic health records (EHR) and compare clinical variables between cases and matched controls.
Methods: We conducted a case-control study using retrospective data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care multi-health system database from 2016 to 2017. The computable phenotype combined ICD codes for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty, with clinical note text terms for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty detected using natural language processing. Cases with these codes or text terms were matched to controls without these codes or text terms matched on birth year, sex and race. Two physicians reviewed EHR for all cases and a subset of controls. Comorbidity codes, laboratory values, and other coded clinical variables were compared between groups using Wilcoxon matched-pair sign-rank test for continuous variables and conditional logistic regression for binary variables.
Results: Cohorts of 9594 cases and 9594 matched controls were generated. Cases were 59\% female, 69\% white, and a median (1st, 3rd quartiles) age 74.9 (62.2, 84.8) years. Most cases were detected by text terms without ICD codes n = 8285 (86.4\%). All cases detected by ICD codes (total n = 1309) also had supportive text terms. Overall 1496 (15.6\%) had concurrent terms or codes for two or more of the three conditions (sarcopenia, cachexia or frailty). Of text term occurrence, 97\% were used positively for sarcopenia, 90\% for cachexia, and 95\% for frailty. The remaining occurrences were negative uses of the terms or applied to someone other than the patient. Cases had lower body mass index, albumin and prealbumin, and significantly higher odds ratios for diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, malignancy, osteoporosis and fractures (all p {\textless} 0.05). Cases were more likely to be prescribed appetite stimulants and caloric supplements.
Conclusions: Patients detected with a computable phenotype for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty differed from controls in several important clinical variables. Potential uses include detection among clinical cohorts for targeting recruitment for research and interventions.},

	abstract = {Long-haul COVID-19, also called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), is a new illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and characterized by the persistence of symptoms. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify a distinct and significant temporal pattern of PASC symptoms (symptom type and onset) among a nationwide sample of PASC survivors (n = 5652). The sample was randomly sorted into two independent samples for exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Five factors emerged from the EFA: (1) cold and flu-like symptoms, (2) change in smell and/or taste, (3) dyspnea and chest pain, (4) cognitive and visual problems, and (5) cardiac symptoms. The CFA had excellent model fit (x2 = 513.721, df = 207, p {\textless} 0.01, TLI = 0.952, CFI = 0.964, RMSEA = 0.024). These findings demonstrate a novel symptom pattern for PASC. These findings can enable nurses in the identification of at-risk patients and facilitate early, systematic symptom management strategies for PASC.},

	abstract = {Aims and Objectives To determine the frequency, timing, and duration of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) and their impact on health and function. Background Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an emerging major public health problem that is poorly understood and has no current treatment or cure. PASC is a new syndrome that has yet to be fully clinically characterised. Design Descriptive cross-sectional survey (n = 5163) was conducted from online COVID-19 survivor support groups who reported symptoms for more than 21 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Participants reported background demographics and the date and method of their covid diagnosis, as well as all symptoms experienced since onset of covid in terms of the symptom start date, duration, and Likert scales measuring three symptom-specific health impacts: pain and discomfort, work impairment, and social impairment. Descriptive statistics and measures of central tendencies were computed for participant demographics and symptom data. Results Participants reported experiencing a mean of 21 symptoms (range 1–93); fatigue (79.0\%), headache (55.3\%), shortness of breath (55.3\%) and difficulty concentrating (53.6\%) were the most common. Symptoms often remitted and relapsed for extended periods of time (duration M = 112 days), longest lasting symptoms included the inability to exercise (M = 106.5 days), fatigue (M = 101.7 days) and difficulty concentrating, associated with memory impairment (M = 101.1 days). Participants reported extreme pressure at the base of the head, syncope, sharp or sudden chest pain, and “brain pressure” among the most distressing and impacting daily life. Conclusions Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be characterised by a wide range of symptoms, many of which cause moderate-to-severe distress and can hinder survivors' overall well-being. Relevance to Clinical Practice This study advances our understanding of the symptoms of PASC and their health impacts.},

	title = {Clinical algorithms, racism, and “fairness” in healthcare: {A} case of bounded justice},
	abstract = {To date, attempts to address racially discriminatory clinical algorithms have largely focused on fairness and the development of models that “do no harm.” While the push for fairness is rooted in a desire to avoid or ameliorate health disparities, it generally neglects the role of racism in shaping health outcomes and does little to repair harm to patients. These limitations necessitate reconceptualizing how clinical algorithms should be designed and employed in pursuit of racial justice and health equity. A useful lens for this work is bounded justice, a concept and research analytic proposed by Melissa Creary to guide multidisciplinary health equity interventions. We describe how bounded justice offers a lens for (1) articulating the deep injustices embedded in the datasets, methodologies, and sociotechnical infrastructure underlying design and implementation of clinical algorithms and (2) envisioning how these algorithms can be redesigned to contribute to larger efforts that not only address current inequities, but to redress the historical mistreatment of communities of color by biomedical institutions. Thus, the aim of this article is two-fold. First, we apply the bounded justice analytic to fairness and clinical algorithms by describing structural constraints on health equity efforts such as medical device regulatory frameworks, race-based medicine, and racism in data. We then reimagine how clinical algorithms could function as a reparative technology to support justice and empower patients in the healthcare system.},
