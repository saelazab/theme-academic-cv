abstract: "Aims and Objectives To determine the frequency, timing, and duration of
  post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) and their impact on health and
  function. Background Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an emerging
  major public health problem that is poorly understood and has no current treatment
  or cure. PASC is a new syndrome that has yet to be fully clinically characterised.
  Design Descriptive cross-sectional survey (n = 5163) was conducted from online COVID-19
  survivor support groups who reported symptoms for more than 21 days following SARS-CoV-2
  infection. Methods Participants reported background demographics and the date and
  method of their covid diagnosis, as well as all symptoms experienced since onset
  of covid in terms of the symptom start date, duration, and Likert scales measuring
  three symptom-specific health impacts: pain and discomfort, work impairment, and
  social impairment. Descriptive statistics and measures of central tendencies were
  computed for participant demographics and symptom data. Results Participants reported
  experiencing a mean of 21 symptoms (range 1–93); fatigue (79.0%), headache (55.3%),
  shortness of breath (55.3%) and difficulty concentrating (53.6%) were the most common.
  Symptoms often remitted and relapsed for extended periods of time (duration M =
  112 days), longest lasting symptoms included the inability to exercise (M = 106.5
  days), fatigue (M = 101.7 days) and difficulty concentrating, associated with memory
  impairment (M = 101.1 days). Participants reported extreme pressure at the base
  of the head, syncope, sharp or sudden chest pain, and “brain pressure” among the
  most distressing and impacting daily life. Conclusions Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2
  infection can be characterised by a wide range of symptoms, many of which cause
  moderate-to-severe distress and can hinder survivors' overall well-being. Relevance
  to Clinical Practice This study advances our understanding of the symptoms of PASC
  and their health impacts."
