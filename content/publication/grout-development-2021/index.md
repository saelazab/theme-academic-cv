abstract: Background:  Many patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remain undiagnosed
  despite availability of interventions to reduce stroke risk. Predictive models to
  date are limited by data requirements and theoretical usage. We aimed to develop
  a model for predicting the 2-year probability of AF diagnosis and implement it as
  proof-of-concept (POC) in a production electronic health record (EHR). Methods: 
  We used a nested case–control design using data from the Indiana Network for Patient
  Care. The develop‑ment cohort came from 2016 to 2017 (outcome period) and 2014 to
  2015 (baseline). A separate validation cohort used outcome and baseline periods
  shifted 2 years before respective development cohort times. Machine learn‑ing approaches
  were used to build predictive model. Patients ≥ 18 years, later restricted to age ≥ 40
  years, with at least two encounters and no AF during baseline, were included. In
  the 6-week EHR prospective pilot, the model was silently implemented in the production
  system at a large safety-net urban hospital. Three new and two previ‑ous logistic
  regression models were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristics. Number,
  characteristics, and ­CHA2DS2-VASc scores of patients identified by the model in
  the pilot are presented. Results:  After restricting age to ≥ 40 years, 31,474 AF
  cases (mean age, 71.5 years; female 49%) and 22,078 controls (mean age, 59.5 years;
  female 61%) comprised the development cohort. A 10-variable model using age, acute
  heart disease, albumin, body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
  gender, heart failure, insurance, kidney disease, and shock yielded the best performance
  (C-statistic, 0.80 [95% CI 0.79–0.80]). The model performed well in the validation
  cohort (C-statistic, 0.81 [95% CI 0.8–0.81]). In the EHR pilot, 7916/22,272 (35.5%;
  mean age, 66 years; female 50%) were identified as higher risk for AF; 5582 (70%)
  had ­CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2. Conclusions:  Using variables commonly available in
  the EHR, we created a predictive model to identify 2-year risk of developing AF
  in those previously without diagnosed AF. Successful POC implementation of the model
  in an EHR provided a practical strategy to identify patients who may benefit from
  interventions to reduce their stroke risk.
