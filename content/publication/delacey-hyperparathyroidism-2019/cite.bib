 abstract = {Backgroundâ€”X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) causes rickets, osteomalacia, skeletal deformities and growth impairment, due to elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 and hypophosphatemia. Conventional therapy requires high doses of phosphate salts combined with active vitamin D analogues. Risks of this regimen include nephrocalcinosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism or progression to tertiary (hypercalcemic) hyperparathyroidism.},
