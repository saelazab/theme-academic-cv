abstract: Backgroundâ€”X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) causes rickets, osteomalacia,
  skeletal deformities and growth impairment, due to elevated fibroblast growth factor
  23 and hypophosphatemia. Conventional therapy requires high doses of phosphate salts
  combined with active vitamin D analogues. Risks of this regimen include nephrocalcinosis
  and secondary hyperparathyroidism or progression to tertiary (hypercalcemic) hyperparathyroidism.
