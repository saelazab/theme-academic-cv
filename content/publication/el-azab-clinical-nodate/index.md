abstract: 'To date, attempts to address racially discriminatory clinical algorithms
  have largely focused on fairness and the development of models that “do no harm.”
  While the push for fairness is rooted in a desire to avoid or ameliorate health
  disparities, it generally neglects the role of racism in shaping health outcomes
  and does little to repair harm to patients. These limitations necessitate reconceptualizing
  how clinical algorithms should be designed and employed in pursuit of racial justice
  and health equity. A useful lens for this work is bounded justice, a concept and
  research analytic proposed by Melissa Creary to guide multidisciplinary health equity
  interventions. We describe how bounded justice offers a lens for (1) articulating
  the deep injustices embedded in the datasets, methodologies, and sociotechnical
  infrastructure underlying design and implementation of clinical algorithms and (2)
  envisioning how these algorithms can be redesigned to contribute to larger efforts
  that not only address current inequities, but to redress the historical mistreatment
  of communities of color by biomedical institutions. Thus, the aim of this article
  is two-fold. First, we apply the bounded justice analytic to fairness and clinical
  algorithms by describing structural constraints on health equity efforts such as
  medical device regulatory frameworks, race-based medicine, and racism in data. We
  then reimagine how clinical algorithms could function as a reparative technology
  to support justice and empower patients in the healthcare system.'
