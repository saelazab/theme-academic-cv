abstract: 'Long-haul COVID-19, also called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC),
  is a new illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and characterized by the persistence
  of symptoms. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify a distinct
  and significant temporal pattern of PASC symptoms (symptom type and onset) among
  a nationwide sample of PASC survivors (n = 5652). The sample was randomly sorted
  into two independent samples for exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses
  (CFA). Five factors emerged from the EFA: (1) cold and flu-like symptoms, (2) change
  in smell and/or taste, (3) dyspnea and chest pain, (4) cognitive and visual problems,
  and (5) cardiac symptoms. The CFA had excellent model fit (x2 = 513.721, df = 207,
  p textless 0.01, TLI = 0.952, CFI = 0.964, RMSEA = 0.024). These findings demonstrate
  a novel symptom pattern for PASC. These findings can enable nurses in the identification
  of at-risk patients and facilitate early, systematic symptom management strategies
  for PASC.'
